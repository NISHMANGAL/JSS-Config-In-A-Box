# JSS-Config-In-A-Box

### Introduction

This allows you to clone a JSS via the API to a new JSS server.

### Attribution

Big thanks to Jeffrey Compton for the API work he did with this:

I have merely restructured a lot of his code to suit my own needs

### Getting started

1. Edit the jss-config-in-a-box.sh script variable, 
2. Run the script.
3. There is no step 3!

The script will prompt you for your JSS server address, then API username and password. The menu is then self explanatory.
